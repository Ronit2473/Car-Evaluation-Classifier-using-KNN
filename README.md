# Car-Evaluation-Classifier-using-KNN
This project implements a machine learning model to classify car evaluations based on various attributes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset used for this project is the car evaluation dataset, which consists of six attributes: buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, capacity in terms of persons to carry, size of luggage boot, and safety of the car. The goal is to predict the overall car evaluation, which can be one of the following categories: unacc (unacceptable), acc (acceptable), good, and vgood (very good).

Key Features
Label Encoding: Converts categorical features into numerical values to be processed by the machine learning algorithm.
K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier: Implements a simple yet effective classification algorithm that makes predictions based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbors.
Data Splitting: Utilizes training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance and avoid overfitting.
Performance Evaluation: Prints the model's accuracy and compares predictions with actual values to provide insights into the classifier's performance.
