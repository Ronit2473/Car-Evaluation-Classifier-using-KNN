Detailed Description
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (car.data) using pandas.
Categorical attributes are converted into numerical values using LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing.
The attributes (buying, maint, door, persons, lug_boot) are encoded and combined into a feature set X.
The target variable (class) is also encoded into numerical values and stored in y.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 90-10 split with train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
A K-Nearest Neighbors classifier is instantiated with 11 neighbors and trained on the training set.
The accuracy of the model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy score is printed.
Predictions are made on the test set, and the predicted class, input data, and actual class are printed for each test instance.
